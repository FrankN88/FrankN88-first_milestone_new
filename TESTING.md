        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable sticky navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Carousel that immediately shows the main features of the place and on top of it a link with a catchy phrase that directs to the menu.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly and change colour when hovering the link.
        2. At the bottom of the each page there is a button that redirects you at the top of the page so that the user does not have to scroll up again, especially on the longer pages and even more if visualised on a small device.
        3. The navigation bar is clearly defined and easily navigable for users to find and use.
        4. The logo image on the top left of each page leads users back to the home page.

        1. The social links are located in the footer together with the restaurant's contacts.
        2. Social links and contacts always adapt responsively in order to be clicked without any difficulty on any device.
        3. The email and phone in the footer contain a link to facilitate communication with the restaurant.

        2. The link will immediately open in a new page a pdf list of wines and beverages with prices and details.

## User testing 
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any feedback and possible way of improving it. Their helpful advice throughout the process led to many UX changes in order to create a better experience, especially regarding the styling. 

It was through this testing that the following changes were made:
- Removing thumbnail from most pictures.
- Centering social media links in the footer instead of floating them to the right.
- Assessing the combinations of colours and the contrast.
- Fonts choice looking smart and not invasive.
- Improving the overall images quality compared to the initial framework idea.
- Overall balance in the positioning and sizing of images in the pages.
