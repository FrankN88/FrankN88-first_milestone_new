## Introduction

This comprehensive website has been designed for the restaurant/wine bar "Pasta & Vino". 

It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential students and partners.

The focus of the site is to create an online presence allowing wine lovers and clients in general, to find out relevant information about the place,its main features, wide range of wines and location. 

"Pasta & Vino" is a restaurant/wine bar whose strenght is in its great choice of wines and carefully selected combinations of pastas and chacuteries.

This is the first of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during their Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirements were to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of three pages using primarily **HTML5** and **CSS3**.
