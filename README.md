 #### Imagery
  -   Imagery is extremely important in hospitality related websites. It is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. 
      The carousel right at the homepage is an immediate example of an element that catches the attention of the user with the most important features of the place.
  
  It also has a modern but classic energetic aesthetic. The imagery it has been thought carefully to draw the attention of the user straight to the points of strenght of the restaurant.

## Features

Each page of the website features a consistent responsive navigational system:
