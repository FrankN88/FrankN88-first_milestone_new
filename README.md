## Introduction

This comprehensive website has been designed for the restaurant/wine bar "Pasta & Vino". 

It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential students and partners.

The focus of the site is to create an online presence allowing wine lovers and clients in general, to find out relevant information about the place,its main features, wide range of wines and location. 

"Pasta & Vino" is a restaurant/wine bar whose strenght is in its great choice of wines and carefully selected combinations of pastas and chacuteries.

This is the first of four Milestone Projects that the developer must complete during their Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. 

The main requirements were to make a responsive and static website with a minimum of three pages using primarily **HTML5** and **CSS3**.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

        7. Make the website as accessible as possible.
        8. Use reviews to increase customer satisfaction.

#### Strategy
Broken into three categories, the website will focus on the following target audiences:

- **Roles:**
 - Current clients of the restaurant
 - Future clients
 - Wine lovers in town

- **Demographic:**
 - 18 or above for the wines and spirits
 - Any age for the restaurant food menu
 - Whoever is in search of a wine experience

The website needs to enable the **User** to:
- Retrieve desired information:
- Menu information
- New imported products
- Upcoming tasting events
- Contact information (standard and social enquires)

The website needs to enable the **Restaurant** to:
- Develop an online presence 
- Provide an easily navigable website for users to find relevant information about:
 - New products
 - New menu and special features connected to the kitchen
 - Provide a channel of communication for enquires (via the form or social media)
 - Provide a channel of communication for new and current clients (Social Links - easily accessible throughout the site with a click)


#### Scope
A scope was defined in order to identify what features have to be included based on the strategy previously defined. This was broken into two categories:

- **Content Requirements**
 - The user will be looking for:
 - General information
 - New products
 - Feedbacks
 - Contact details
 - Social Links

- **Functionality Requirements**
  - The user will be able to:
    - Easily navigate through the site in order to find the information they want
    - Be able to find links to external sites in order to:
        - Verify the status of the place
        - Find directions
        - Have always under control news and specials
        - Contact the restaurant directly through the contacts

#### Structure
The information architecture was organized in a fluid and clear way in order to ensure that users could navigate through the site with ease and efficiency.

![Site Map](assets/testing_files/ux_stories_screenshots/structure_website2.png)

#### Skeleton 
Wireframe mockups were created in a [Figma Workspace](assets/testing_files/figma_wireframe/wireframe_figma-compressed.pdf).
The pdf file generated by Figma was too big to be loaded onto GitHub. I have compressed the file with Adobe Acrobat - Compress PDF.
and put it into a separate folder available for download or visualization in GitHub Desktop.

Several style changes were made in the final project compared to the inital wireframe on Figma. Those changes were mainly related to the choice of different pictures to better suit the new layout and Bootstrap features (e.g. Carousel,cards etc), colours, font size, positioning in the page; all aimed to provide the best user experience and responsiveness.

**Pages:**
 1. Home Page:

 4. About us

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
  - The main colours used throughout the website are a mixture of dark purple (to represent the colour of wine), White (as a clear and non-invasive contrast colour to the previous one), black fonts.

#### Typography
  -   The Oswald font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Nunito as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

#### Imagery
  -   Imagery is extremely important in hospitality related websites. It is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. 
      The carousel right at the homepage is an immediate example of an element that catches the attention of the user with the most important features of the place.

  - It also has a modern but classic aesthetic. The imagery it has been thought carefully to draw the attention of the user straight to the points of strenght of the restaurant.

## Features
### Design Features
Each page of the website features a consistent responsive navigational system:
- A responsive top **Banner** positioned at the very beginning of the page entirely for aesthetic reasons.
- The **Header** contains a conventionally placed **logo** in the top left of the page (whereby by clicking this will redirect users back to the home page) and **navigation bar** in the top right of the page.
- On smaller screens, the navigation bar collapses into a **toggler** icon whereby clicking it will reveal the navigation and social links.
- On larger screens, the **Footer** contains the appropriate **social media icons**, linking users to the main social pages of the restaurant.
- In the Footer there is a mailto action above the email.
- <li><strong>Let us spoil you/Top Menu</strong> - Those <strong>call to action</strong> buttons are present at least once in every page (except for the menu, which is the page they redirect to) so that the users are prone to clicking, therefore visualising the menu.
</li>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="index.html" target="_blank" alt="Pasta & Vino Home Page">Home Page</a></dt>
  <dd>The Home Page consists of the following elements:
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Hero Image/carousel</strong> - Occupying 100% of the page width, from the left side to the right one, while viewing on all devices. The imagery used was specifically chosen as it created a impactful first impression of the place with inspiring images, preparing the user to then rest of the page and the following pages.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Card list</strong> - Occupying 80% of the width, from left to right, while viewing on a desktop. On mobile and tablet devices, the card list responsively positions vertically, underneath the <strong>Carousel</strong>. The purpose of the card list is to provide an area in the center to highlight the three main features of the restaurant. This style was chosen in order to draw the users attention to the information straight away. In this, there is a <strong>call to action</strong> button linking to the external page where users are invited to check out the impressive wine/spirits list, on of the main features of the place.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Feedback</strong> - Those positive <strong>reviews</strong> are positioned just below the card list to increase trust in the user.
          </li>
     </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="menu.html" target="_blank" alt="Menu Page">Menu Page</a></dt>
  <dd>The Menu page consists of the following elements:
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Card list</strong> - Occupying about 80% of the page, this comprehensive card list shows the main and most popular dishes of the restaurant. It starts with appetizers to end with desserts.
          Once again in the wine part it is present a <strong>call to action</strong> button that redirects the user to an external pdf page with the wine/spirits menu.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Notices</strong> - At the end of the page there are some notices that indicate information about the place.
          </li>
     </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="gallery.html" target="_blank" alt="Menu Page">Gallery Page</a></dt>
  <dd>The Gallery page consists of the following elements:
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Collage</strong> - Occupying about 50% of the page, this impressive and resposive gallery has the goal of showing the place in a way that catches the user's attention. The images have an ease-in-out effect in order to be more interesting and fun. Furthermore, every time the user hovers the images it appears the name of the place in a way that is not invasive but effective.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Google Maps</strong> - iframe embedding of Google maps, showing the location of the restaurant. The map is responsive in smaller devices.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Youtube Video</strong> - iframe embedding a Youtube video showing a chef plating up. Once again, an element meant for catching the user's attention and increase curiosity.
          </li>
     </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="about_us.html" target="_blank" alt="About us Page">About Us</a></dt>
  <dd>The About Us page consists of the following elements:
     <ul>
          <li><strong>Main Image</strong> - Catchy image thought to catch the attention of the user on a feature of the restaurant (homemade pasta) and convey it to the following element.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Our Driving Force</strong> - Two card next to each other with a description of the two main protagonist of the restaurant.
          This part is thought for the users who want to know more about the two people who represent the strong points of the place and its success.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Secon Main Image</strong> - Catchy image thought to catch the attention of the user on a feature of the restaurant (main dining area) and as a sort of separation for the following element.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Form</strong> - A standard form for the users who want to subscribe.
          </li>
     </ul>
  </dd>

  </dl>

### Features to Implement in the future

- **Merchandise Shop**
     - **Feature** - set up a shop where clients can buy wines or book tables directly via the website.
     - **Reason for not featuring in this release** - Not possible with only CSS and HTML.

     - **Feature** - Operational form.
     - **Reason for not featuring in this release** - Not possible with only CSS and HTML.

## Issues and Bugs 
The developer ran into a number of issues during the development of the pages.
The guiding approach in developing the website was the motto "Mobile First". That aims to create better experiences for users by starting the design process from the smallest of screens: mobile.

**Navbar issue** - An initial issue was to position the navar links aligned with the logo. That has been resolved with a few trials on where to position the right div.

**Social Links Bug** - A bug was found when testing the social media links. It would not redirect to the right page giving an error message. It has been resolved with iserting a more complete URL.

**Gallery Issue** - A great amount of time has been dedicated to find the best suited style for a gallery that could be at the same time responsive and aesthetically pleasing. After many trials with Bootstrap and other solutions the best approach in this very case was a gallery made with CSS Media Queries.

**Iframe Bug** - Am iframe related bug was found when reducing the screen size. Google Maps Iframe would not be responsive in smaller devices and overflow the screen size. It has been resolved with using the Bootstrap classes as in the Youtube iframe.

**HTML Validators related Bugs**
- one too many closing tag for the icon in all of footers.
- empty h5 tags in all of the html pages.
- Unnedeed spacing in the phone number in the footers.
- "Frameborder" attribute in the iframe deemed obsolete.
- Several errors all related to a wrong filing of the form labels and attributes.

**CSS Validators related Bugs**
- Width value not recognized
- Wrong value for padding
- Wrong position value
- Wrong value for the ease-in-out effect


### Known Bugs

-   In the Galaxy Fold configuration, in the footer, the social network icons tend slightly to the right instead of being perfectly center aligned.
- The two Images of the chef have a slightly different height that could not be resolved in a way that was effective and and the same time 100% responsive.
